This folder includes the .style files and the True Type fonts (.ttf) included with the 
PLTS Mapping Agency Solution software. 

The .style files are dependent on the PLTS font files. The fonts need to be installed in your
$\Windows\Fonts directory. Make sure you install the fonts before accessing these Styles in ArcMap.
You will need administrative privileges in order to install the fonts. 

The .style files should be copied to your ArcGIS install location in the $\Program Files\ArcGIS\Styles
directory.
